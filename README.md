#Jarvis

Jarvis allows you to control your Mac with your voice.
Unlike mobile assistants, Jarvis is made to be used when you're not directly at your computer.

##Usage

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Start your commands with "Hey Jarvis, ..." (unless its just a greeting).
E.g. "Hey Jarvis, tell me a joke" or "Hey Jarvis, show me pictures of cats".

##List of Available Commands

Note: { } indicate optional commands

1. Greeting: "Hey Jarvis!"
2. Day Summary: "Tell me about my day", "What does my day look like", etc.
3. Search Internet: "Search for the University of Waterloo", "Show me pictures of cats", etc. 
4. Launch Applications: "Start Pages", "Launch Safari", etc.
5. Set Reminders: "Remind me to mow the lawn {tomorrow at 8AM}", "Remind me to hand in my assignment {at 5 o'clock}", etc.
6. Weather: "What is the weather like right now", "How cold is it outside?", etc.
7. Time: "What time is it?", "Do you have the time?", "Show me the time", etc.
8. Music: "Play some music", "Play Call Me Maybe", etc.

##Installation
Make sure you have LAME installed.  

We recommend installing it using homebrew.
